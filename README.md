# hexki-alacritty
This is my personal Alacritty Terminal config, and i guess bash config.

My bash is by Chris Titus Tech's mybash project.

Now to my terminal. 

make sure you have the JetBrainsMono Nerd Font fonts installed.

for example using Arch Linux;
``sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd``
then download the alacritty.toml file and place it in your alacritty config file. for example, in your home directory,``/.config/alacritty/``.
after that you SHOULD be good to go.
